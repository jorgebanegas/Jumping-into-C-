1. Write a program that prints out the entire lyrics to a full rendition of "99 bottles of beer".
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
      for(int i = 99;i > 1;i--)
      {
        cout << i << " bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.\n\tTake one down and pass it around " << i-1 << "  bottles of beer on the wall\n"; 
       
        if(i == 1)
        {
            cout << "1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.\n\tTake one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall";
        }
      }
      cout << "No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer. \n\tGo to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.";
  }
  
2. Write a menu program that lets the user select from a list of options, and if the input is not one of the options, reprint the list. 
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
      int input = 0;
      do
      {
          cout << "Enter the given command number\n" << " 1: Power off\n 2: Reset Power\n 3: Power ON\n 4: Erase\n";
          cin >> input;
      }
      while (input != 1 && input != 2 && input != 3 && input != 4 && input != 5);
    
      cout << "Thank you";
  }
