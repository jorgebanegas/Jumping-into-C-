1. Ask the user for two users' ages and indicate who is older; behave differently if both are over 100.
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
      int age1 = 0;
      int age2 = 0;

      cout << "Please enter the age of person 1 ";
      cin >> age1;
      cout << "Please enter the age of person 2 ";
      cin >> age2;

      if (age1 > age2)
          cout << "Person 1 is older";
      if (age1 < age2)
          cout << "Person 2 is older" << "\n";
      if (age1 >= 100 && age2 >= 100)
          cout << "Wow you two are soo old!";
  }
  
2. Implement a simple "password" system that takes a password in the form of a number. Make it so that either of two numbers are valid, but use only one if statement to do the check.
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;
  
  int main()
  {
      int password = 0;
    
      cout << "Please enter your numerical password << "\n";
      cin >> password;
      if (password == 12345 || password = 101010)
          cout << "Access granted";
      else
          cout << "Access denied";
  }
  
  3. Write a small calculator that takes as inout one of the four arithmetic operations, the two arguments to those operations, the two arguments to those operations, and them prints out the results/
  
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        char arithmetic_expression = 'a';
        int number1 = 0;
        int number2 = 0;
        int results = 0;

        cout << "Please enter the value for number1" << "\n";
        cin >> number1;
        cout << "Please enter the value for number2" << "\n";
        cin >> number2;
        cout << "Now enter the arithmetic expression to use" << "\n";
        cin >> arithmetic_expression;

        if(arithmetic_expression == '*')
        {
            results = number1 * number2;
            cout << "Result: " << results;
        }
        else if(arithmetic_expression == '+')
        {
            results = number1 + number2;
            cout << "Result: " << results;
        }
        else if(arithmetic_expression == '-')
        {
            results = number1 - number2;
            cout << "Result: " << results;
        }
        else if(arithmetic_expression == '/')
        {
            results = number1 / number2;
            cout << "Result: " << results;
        }
        else
            cout << "Sorry wrong output!";
    }
