1. Write a program that prints out the entire lyrics to a full rendition of "99 bottles of beer".
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
      for(int i = 99;i > 1;i--)
      {
        cout << i << " bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.\n\tTake one down and pass it around " << i-1 << "  bottles of beer on the wall\n"; 
       
        if(i == 1)
        {
            cout << "1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.\n\tTake one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall";
        }
      }
      cout << "No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer. \n\tGo to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.";
  }
