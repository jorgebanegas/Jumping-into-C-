1. Take the "menu program" you wrote earlier and break it out into a series of call to functions for each of the menu items.
   Add the calculator and "100 bottles of beer" as two different functions that can be called. 
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   void menu()
     {
         int input = 0;
         do
         {
            cout << "Enter the given command number\n" << " 1: Power off\n 2: Reset Power\n 3: Power ON\n 4: Erase\n";
            cin >> input;
         }
         while (input != 1 && input != 2 && input != 3 && input != 4 && input != 5);
    
         cout << "Thank you";
   }
  
   void song()
   {
         for(int i = 99;i > 1;i--)
         {
         cout << i << " bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.\n\tTake one down and pass it around " << i-1 << "  bottles of beer on the wall\n"; 
       
         if(i == 1)
         {
               cout << "1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.\n\tTake one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall";
         }
         }
         cout << "No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer. \n\tGo to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.";
   }
  
  
   void calculator()
      {
         char arithmetic_expression = 'a';
         int number1 = 0;
         int number2 = 0;
         int results = 0;

         cout << "Please enter the value for number1" << "\n";
         cin >> number1;
         cout << "Please enter the value for number2" << "\n";
         cin >> number2;
         cout << "Now enter the arithmetic expression to use" << "\n";
         cin >> arithmetic_expression;

         if(arithmetic_expression == '*')
         {
               results = number1 * number2;
               cout << "Result: " << results;
         }
         else if(arithmetic_expression == '+')
         {
               results = number1 + number2;
               cout << "Result: " << results;
         }
         else if(arithmetic_expression == '-')
         {
               results = number1 - number2;
               cout << "Result: " << results;
         }
         else if(arithmetic_expression == '/')
         {
               results = number1 / number2;
               cout << "Result: " << results;
         }
         else
               cout << "Sorry wrong output!";
      }
    
   int main()
   {
      int input = 0;
      do
      {
      cout << "Please select the function number \n" << "1: Menu 2: Song 3: Calculator\n";
      cin >> input;
    
      if (input == 1)
         menu();
      if (input == 2)
         song();
      if (input == 3)
         calculator();
         else 
         cout << "Input invalid";
      }
      while(input!= 0);
   }
