1. Write a program that outputs your name.
  #include <string>
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
      {
          string name = "";
          cout << "Please enter your name ";
          getline(cin,name,'\n');
          cout << "Your name is " << name << "\n" ;
      }
      
 2. Write a program that reads in two numbers and adds them together. 
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
      {
         int number1 = 0;
          int number2 = 0;
          int result = 0;

          cout << "Please enter a value for number 1 : ";
          cin >> number1;
          cout << "Please enter a value for number 2 : ";
          cin >> number2;
          result = number1 + number2;
          cout << "When added together, your new value is " << result << "\n";
      }
    
 3. Write a program that performs divisions of two numbers read from the user and prints out an exact result. Make sure to test your prgro
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
      {
          double number1 = 0;
          double number2 = 0;
          double result = 0;

          cout << "Please enter a value for number 1 : ";
          cin >> number1;
          cout << "Please enter a value for number 2 : ";
          cin >> number2;
          result = number1 / number2;
          cout << "When divided, your new value is " << result << "\n";
      }
