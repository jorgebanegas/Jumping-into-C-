1. Rewrite the menu program you wrote in the previous chapters and use switch case. 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
  {
      int input = 0;
          cout << "Enter the given command number\n" << " 1: Power off\n 2: Reset Power\n 3: Power ON\n 4: Erase\n";
          cin >> input;
          switch (input)
          {
              case 1: cout << "Powering off";
              break;
              case 2: cout << "Resetting Power";
              break;
              case 3: cout << "Powering On";
              break;
              case 4: cout << "Erasing all data";
              break;
              default: cout<< "Thank you";
              break;
          }
  }
  
  2. Write a program that outputs the results of the 12 days of christmas using switch case.
  
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int counter = 1;
    
    while(counter <= 12){
        cout << "On the " << counter << " day of Christmas my true love sent to me:";
    switch (counter)
    {
        case 12: cout << "12 Drummers Drumming\n";
        case 11: cout << "11 Pipers Piping\n";
        case 10: cout << "10 Lords a Leaping\n";
        case 9: cout << "9 Ladies Dancing\n";
        case 8: cout << "8 Maids a Milking\n";
        case 7: cout << "7 Swans a Swimming\n";
        case 6: cout << "6 Geese a Laying\n";
        case 5: cout << "5 Golden Rings\n";
        case 4: cout << "4 Calling Birds\n";
        case 3: cout << "3 French Hens\n";
        case 2: cout << "2 Turtle Doves\n";
        case 1: cout << "A Partridge in a Pear Tree\n\n";
        default: break;
    }
    counter++;
    }
}

3. Write a two player tic tac toe game; use enums when possible to represent the values of the board. 

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    enum board {blank = 0, player1 = 1, player2 = 2};
    string input;
    int game = 0;
    int one_one = blank, one_two = blank, one_three = blank;
    int two_one = blank, two_two = blank, two_three = blank;
    int three_one = blank, three_two = blank, three_three = blank;
    
    cout << "Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!\n";
    do
    {
      cout << "Player 1, enter board position eg. one_one\n";
      cin >> input;
      if(input == "one_one")
        one_one = player1;
      if(input == "one_two") 
        one_two = player1;
      if(input == "one_three")
        one_three = player1;

        two_three = player1;
      if(input == "three_one")
        three_one = player1;
      if(input == "three_two")
        three_two = player1;
      if(input == "three_three")
        three_three = player1;
          
      if(one_one = player1 && one_two == player1 && one_three ==player1)
      {
        cout << "Player 1 wins!";
        game = 1;
        continue;
      }
      else if (two_one == player1 && two_two == player1 && two_three == player1)
      {
        cout << "Player 1 wins!";

        {

        continue;
        }
