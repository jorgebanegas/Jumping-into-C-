1. Write a program that prints out the entire lyrics to a full rendition of "99 bottles of beer".
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
      for(int i = 99;i > 1;i--)
      {
        cout << i << " bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.\n\tTake one down and pass it around " << i-1 << "  bottles of beer on the wall\n"; 
       
        if(i == 1)
        {
            cout << "1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.\n\tTake one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall";
        }
      }
      cout << "No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer. \n\tGo to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.";
  }
  
2. Write a menu program that lets the user select from a list of options, and if the input is not one of the options, reprint the list. 
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
      int input = 0;
      do
      {
          cout << "Enter the given command number\n" << " 1: Power off\n 2: Reset Power\n 3: Power ON\n 4: Erase\n";
          cin >> input;
      }
      while (input != 1 && input != 2 && input != 3 && input != 4 && input != 5);
    
      cout << "Thank you";
  }

3. Write a program that computes a running sum of inputs from the user, terminating when the user gives an input value of 0. 
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main() 
  {
      int input = 0;
      int sum = 0;
      do
      {
          cout << "Please enter a number to add ";
          cin >> input;
          sum = sum + input;
          cout << sum << "\n";
      }
      while(input != 0);
      cout << "Exiting...";
    
  }
  
4. Write a password prompt that gives a user only a certain number og password entry attempts so that he user gives cannot easily write a password cracker.
  #include <iostream>
  #include <string>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
      string password = "";
      for (int i = 1;i <= 3;i++)
      {
          cout << "Please enter your password: ";
          getline(cin,password,'\n');
        
          if(password != "1234567" && i <= 2)
          {
              cout << "Attempt number " << i << " failed.\n Please try again.\n";
          }
        
          if(password == "1234567")
          {
              cout << "Access granted\n";
              break;
          }
          if (password != "1234567" && i == 3)
          cout << "Maximum attempts used. Goodbye";
      }

  }
  
  5. Write a program that displays the first 20 square numbers.
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
      for(int i = 1;i <=20;i++)
      {
          cout << i << " : " << (i*i) << "\n";
      }
        
  }
  
  6. Write a program that provides the option of tallying up the results of a poll with 3 possible values. 
    The first input to the program is the poll question; thenest three inouts are the possible answers. 
    The first answer is indicated by 1, the second by 2, the third by 3. The answers are tallied until a 0 is entered. 
    The program should then show the results of the poll, 
    try making a bar graph that shows the results properly scaled to fit on your screen no matter how many results were entered.
